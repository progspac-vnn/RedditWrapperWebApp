# Building a Reddit Wrapper WebApp

Your goal is to build a basic web application that fetches articles from a subreddit of your choice using the free Reddit API. The application should use a REST API interface to retrieve the last 10 threads from the selected subreddit and display them on a simple front end.

### Requirements:

### Backend:

- Use Python to create the backend of the web application.
- Utilize the Reddit API to fetch articles from the chosen subreddit.
- Expose a REST API endpoint that returns the last 10 threads as JSON data.

### Frontend:

- Create a simple HTML page with basic styling (no need for complex designs).
- Use JavaScript to fetch data from the REST API endpoint and display the articles on the page.

### Functionality:

- The front end should display the following information for each article: title, author, creation date, and a link to the original thread.
- Ensure that the application is responsive and functional on different devices.

### Documentation:

- Include a brief explanation of how to run your application.
- Provide a list of any third-party libraries you used.

### Submission:

Please create a GitHub repository for this task and share the link with us at [ayugarg567@gmail.com](mailto:ayugarg567@gmail.com) Your repository should include the source code, any necessary configuration files, and a README with instructions on how to run the application. Make sure you submit it by August 28, 2023. 

### Evaluation:

We will assess your submission based on the following criteria:

- Code quality and organization
- API interaction and data retrieval

Feel free to ask any clarifying questions if needed. Good luck, and we're looking forward to seeing your solution!
